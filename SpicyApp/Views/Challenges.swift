It HAS TO be a total stranger, someone you donâ€™t know. Maybe someone you see sitting there by themselves or someone who inspires you just as you walk into the cafÃ¨. \nYou approach them, you drink coffee together and the rest should come by itself! Be proud of yourself, you met someone new and youâ€™re probably drinking a really good coffee.", Tips: "Here there are some suggestions for you: \n- Approach them kindly and ask them if theyâ€™re okay with sharing some time with you.\\n- Just move to the next person if theyâ€™re not available, itâ€™s okay! \n- You can also ask it to a group of two/three people: the more the better! \n- You donâ€™t necessarily have to drink coffee if you or the other person doesnâ€™t feel like it; however having a warm cup in your hands might be nice! \n- Share your plans or your location with a friend or family so that they always know that youâ€™re safe and keep them updated about where you are and if you are feeling comfortable enough to stay. \n- RELAX! Youâ€™re getting out of your comfort zone, it might not be the easiest thing to do but donâ€™t forget to breathe and feel proud of yourself!" ),
